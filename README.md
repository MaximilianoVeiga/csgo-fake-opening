## Description

csgo-fake-opening is a tool that allows you to simulate opening crates and capsules in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) without actually having the items in your inventory. With this tool, you can open an unlimited number of crates and capsules, including those for tournaments. You can also configure the probability of getting certain items.

The tool provides an in-game configuration menu that is built with the user interface library, ImGui. This menu allows you to easily create the crates and keys you want to open and start opening them.

- Open any crate/capsule you want
- Support for tournaments crates

- In-game configuration with <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">ImGui</a>
